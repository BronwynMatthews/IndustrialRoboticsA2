Selected Project: DishBot Duo

Project Description: We propose the integration of a dual robotic system aimed at enhancing plate management efficiency in a commercial kitchen. An ABB Single Arm YuMi will be positioned by the dishwasher. It will extract and sort plates of various colours onto miniature pallets. It will operate by collecting all like plates and palletising them, and then proceed to the next plate colour grouping for palletising. Simultaneously a LinearUR5 will pick up the completed palletised plate stacks and systematically and safely place them onto corresponding shelves. The LinearUR5 will have a pallet-tine like end effector to collect these pallets.
